    Specify the git url to find the agents Dockerfile's for building the agents on demands.
    If the value is not empty it will be passed to the AgentProvisionJob and AgentDecomissionJob
    as parameter with the name 'gitUrl'.
    It's support placeholder for the label value that is replaced with the label at provision time. 
    For example the following value 'https://github.com/fr123k/jocker-agents-{label}' for the label 'golang' is transformed to 'https://github.com/fr123k/jocker-agents-golang'.
